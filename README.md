# 🚀 Prerequisites
- 📱 **A phone with MIUI 12 or higher (You dont need to do this on versions <12)**
- 📁 **USB Debugging**
- 🆕 **A custom launcher, obviously...**


# 🥇 First Steps
## 1. Installing Apps

### 1.1 FNG
Download an app called "Fluid Navigation Gestures" from the Google Play Store. 
Open it and grant the permissions necessary. After that, open the Security app from your app drawer
and then go to Boost Apps. Click on the gear icon on the top right and select **Locked Apps**, here enable FNG.

Now go to Settings>Apps>Manage Apps>Background Autostart and give FNG the permission.

### 1.2 Download LADB from this link: [Click me](https://github.com/hyperio546/ladb-builds/releases/tag/v2.3.1)

LADB is currently paid but you can download the free builds from here. I would recommend to not download it from an unknown source unless it's Apkvision or ApkMirror...

# 🥈 The Process

After you setup FNG, you should be able to use the gestures provided by the app. But, the navigation buttons are still there and Xiaomi
does not allow you to change back to Gestures since MIUI 13. On MIUI 12 and MIUI 12.5 you could change back to Gestures without functionallity. 
This is the main reason why we installed LADB. 

### 2.1 Removing the buttons

Open LADB. You will get a notice asking you to provide a port and a pairing code.
For this, go to Settings>Developer Options>Wireless debugging and turn it on.
Click on the option saying "Pair with 6 digit code". 

You will see a dialog simillar to this
